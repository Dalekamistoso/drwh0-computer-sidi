	To install the CD-ROM device driver, the syntax in CONFIG.SYS
     is as follows:

     DEVICE=VIDE-CDD.SYS /D:MSCD001 [/P:xxx,yy] [/L:xx]

     where [/P:xxx,yy]
          specifies the IDE port which is connected to the drive and the
          interrupt request.

          'xxx' is the base address (hexadecimal notation) of IDE port.
                xxx = 1f0 : Port 1
                      170 : Port 2
                      1e8 : Port 3
                      168 : Port 4

          'yy' is the interrupt number (decimal notation) of the
          corresponding IDE port.

	[/L:xx]
	  specifies the message language. Available options are listed
	  as below:

		xx = US : English (the default language)
		     GR : German
		     FR : French
		     SP : Spanish
		     IT : Italian
		     JP : Japanese

     For example,  when eight drives are installed, the command
     line in the CONFIG.SYS file could be entered as follows:

     DEVICE=VIDE-CDD.SYS /D:MSCD001 /P:1f0,14 /P:170,15 /P:1e8,12 /P:168,10

     NOTE:

	Our device driver will automatically search the drives for 4 ports
     up to 8 drives, and the ports are 0x1f0, 0x170, 0x1e8 and 0x168 with
     interrupt number 14, 15, 12 and 10 as default, respectively. If your
     IDE ports and their respective interrupt numbers are the same as
     those mentioned above, you don't have to specify them verbosely.

	To enable the CD-ROM drive to read CD-ROM discs using the High
     Sierra or ISO 9660 format, you not only need to install the CD-ROM
     device driver, but also need to insert the following line into your
     AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

     MSCDEX /D:MSCD001

	To have a detail knowledge about the MSCDEX.EXE program, please
     refer to MS-DOS user manual.

Q. Why cannot I do a directory (dir) on a good ISO-9660 format disc
   on my CD-ROM drive although it is ready?
A. Your CD-ROM drive might work on PIO mode zero only. When your PC
   system is configured in a faster IDE interface mode, this CD-ROM
   drive might get this kind of communication problem. The solution
   will be that you have to turn down the interface speed between
   the CD-ROM drive and your PC system through BIOS or interface
   card setting. After the configuration is changed, you need to
   reboot the system.

Q. Why is it slow to read files for my CD-ROM. How to get it faster?
A. The MSCDEX.EXE allocates memory for caching information on the
   CD-ROM. You can set the /M:<value> to determine how many sector
   buffers MSCDEX allocates when it installs itself. Typically, each
   drive should have a minimum 4-5 buffers per drive and the higher
   this value is, the better the drive performance would be.

Q. I have an enhanced IDE card with two ports, but I cannot install the
   CD-ROM drive on the secondary port properly.
A. The secondary port on some enhanced IDE card (eg. CMD0640x) is left
   un-opened when the PC system is initially powered on. Under such a
   condition, the CD-ROM device driver will not act stably when this
   CD-ROM drive installed. To resolve this problem, you can install
   the device driver bundled with your enhanced IDE card to open the
   secondary port.

Q. The SKIP button doesn't skip while a 'CD PLAYER' like program is
   playing.
A. Based upon the design philosophy of this CD-ROM drive, the application
   program has a higher priority than the manual pressing buttons so
   that the interference between "manual pressing button" and
   "application program" can be avoided. Therefore, during play under
   application program, the CD-ROM drive will not respond when the
   "SKIP" button is pressed. Besides, the tray will be opened when the
   "STOP" button is pressed.
